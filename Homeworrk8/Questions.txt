Logistic Regression:

Try different thresholds for computing predictions. By default it is 0.5. Use predict_proba function to compute probabilities and then try custom thresholds and see their impact on Accuracy, Precision and Recall

Do the same analysis for other columns

Fit a Logistic Regression Model on all features. Remember to preprocess data(eg. normalization and one hot encoding)

Plot ROC Curves for each model

Clustering:
Repeat the above exercise for different values of k
How do the inertia and silhouette scores change?
What if you don't scale your features?
Is there a 'right' k? Why or why not?
Repeat the following exercise for food nutrients dataset
